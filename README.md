# Dux-Tube

### [Deployed Site](https://duxtube.vercel.app/)

## Abstract
Dux-Tube is a React application that displays video thumbnails and has an embdedded viewing screen for users to watch the videos, as well as the ability to save videos in another section. The videos are pulled from an array of the most popular videos on Pexels via the Pexels API.

This app uses the React Redux state management library and was created primarily as an exercise to gain a further understanding of Redux and state management. I was also interested in getting some exposure to working with embedded video as well. Though the app is limited in scope, I was successful in utilizing Redux's global state store and accessing and updating it across various components.

## Technologies Used
- React
- React Redux + Redux Toolkit
- [React Player](https://github.com/CookPete/react-player) - React component for embedding video.
- Tailwind CSS
- [Pexels API](https://www.pexels.com/api/)
- Vite

## Future Extensions
Since this was primarily a learning exercise, in the future I will be including more features and parts to make this a more complete and robust app, including testing, responsive CSS, more video embedding, and more data manipulation from the incoming API fetch responses.
